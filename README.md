# Estimating Aerosol Optical Properties Using Mie Theory and Analyzing Their Impact on Radiative Forcing in California
<img align = "left" src="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sarp-patch.jpeg?w=1280&format=webp" alt="drawing" width="200"/>During the summer of 2024 I participated in [NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) in California](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/student-airborne-research-program/). I got the privilege to fly on NASA's P-3 research aircraft as well as a B200 plane sampling airborne data. We also got the chance to take gas samples at the Salton Sea.

As part of the Aerosol group I wanted to focus my project on aerosol optics and radiative balance. My project estimates the scattering and back-scattering efficiencies of sampled aerosols using their composition and size data. I used this information along with onboard optical data to determine the relative radiative forcing using an equation from [Langridge 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JD017116).

This project was advised by [Andreas Beyersdorf](https://www.csusb.edu/profile/andreas.beyersdorf), [Ann Marie Carlton](https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/ann-marie-carlton), [Maddy Landi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonlandi1/), and [Disha Sardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disha-sardana/). Previous SARP students [Aly Fritzmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyson-fritzmann-6b9381149/) and [Julia Alvarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-alv720506/) provided guiding resources for this project.
