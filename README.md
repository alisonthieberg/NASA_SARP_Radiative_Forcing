# Estimating Aerosol Optical Properties Using Mie Theory and Analyzing Their Impact on Radiative Forcing in California
<img align = "left" src="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sarp-patch.jpeg?w=1280&format=webp" alt="drawing" width="200"/>During the summer of 2024 I participated in [NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) in California](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/student-airborne-research-program/). I got the privilege to fly on NASA's P-3 research aircraft as well as a B200 plane sampling airborne data. We also got the chance to take gas samples at the Salton Sea.

As part of the Aerosol group I wanted to focus my project on aerosol optics and radiative balance. My project estimates the scattering and back-scattering efficiencies of sampled aerosols using their composition and size data. I used this information along with onboard optical data to determine the relative radiative forcing using an equation from [Langridge 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JD017116).

This project was advised by [Andreas Beyersdorf](https://www.csusb.edu/profile/andreas.beyersdorf), [Ann Marie Carlton](https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/ann-marie-carlton), [Maddy Landi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonlandi1/), and [Disha Sardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disha-sardana/). Previous SARP students [Aly Fritzmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyson-fritzmann-6b9381149/) and [Julia Alvarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-alv720506/) provided guiding resources for this project.

## Abstract
Anthropogenic aerosols, unlike greenhouse gasses, provide a net cooling effect to the Earth’s surface. Particles suspended in the atmosphere have the ability to scatter incoming solar radiation, preventing that radiation from heating up the surface. These aerosols like black carbon, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and organics are byproducts of both natural and anthropogenic activities. Measuring radiative forcing as a result of these aerosols over time can provide insight on how anthropogenic industries are altering our Earth’s temperature. This study analyzes the changes in radiative forcing from aerosols in central and southern California using data collected from NASA SARP flights from 2016-2024. Aerosol size, composition, and single scattering albedo were used to estimate the aerosol characteristics and to calculate the aerosols’ radiative forcing efficiency. Our results show that aerosols are found to have less of a cooling effect over time when looking at the change in radiative forcing in California from 2016 to 2024. When narrowing in on specific geographic regions, we observe the same trends in the Central Valley with the area becoming warmer as a result of aerosols. However, more southern regions like Los Angeles and the Inland Empire have become cooler from aerosols during this time period. The overall decrease in the cooling effect of California’s aerosols could indicate that the average size of particulates is changing or that the aerosol composition could be shifting to a greater concentration of absorbing aerosols rather than scattering aerosols. This study shows how aerosols influence radiative forcing and their subsequent impacts across regions in California from multiple years.
